                    Welcome to MyZou Buddy, a student matching tool designed to connect you with your ideal study buddy! We are determined to bridge connections between individuals in the same classes. Our goal is to build a sense of community at The University of Missouri's big campus. In the past few years, the rapid availability of online classes has deteriorated the sense of community on our campus. This program allows students to input one or more of their classes to match with their study buddy. We are glad you are helping us spread our mission. I hope you enjoy spending time with your study buddy. Let's navigate Mizzou together!
